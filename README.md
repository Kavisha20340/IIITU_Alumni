# IIITU_Alumni
This is a simple Django project which I made in my 4th semester. The idea of creating an alumni network for my college had always been in my head and recently I had learnt the basics of Django so I started implementing my idea at a basic level using Django framework which solidified my learnings of Django as a beginner. I aspire to add more functionalities in this project while exploring advanced features of Django. It features the alumni of college with their contact and work profile details in order to facilitate students in reaching out to them for guidance and career oppurtunities.
